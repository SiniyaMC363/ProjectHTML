Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. Known for its platform independence, Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere," meaning code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java ideal for building cross-platform applications.

Java is widely used in various domains such as web development, mobile app development (especially Android), enterprise software, and cloud computing. Its syntax is similar to C++, but with a simpler object-oriented approach and enhanced security features. Java supports multithreading, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and a rich set of APIs that simplify complex programming tasks.

With its strong community support, robust frameworks like Spring and Hibernate, and a vast ecosystem of tools, Java remains one of the most popular and reliable programming languages for both beginners and professionals
