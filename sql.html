    <img src="/Sql_data_base_with_logo.png" alt="" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (commonly referred to as CRUD operations) stored in database systems. Originally developed by IBM in the 1970s and later adopted as a standard by ANSI and ISO, SQL has become the foundation of most relational database systems like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

SQL uses simple, English-like syntax, making it easy to learn and use, even for beginners. It provides powerful commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP to interact with data and database structures. SQL also supports features like filtering, sorting, joining tables, and grouping data for analysis.

SQL plays a crucial role in data science, web development, business intelligence, and any field where structured data storage and retrieval are essential. It is an indispensable tool for database management and data analysis.</p>
