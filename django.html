    <h1>DJANGO</h1>
    <img src="./django-logo-big-removebg-preview.png" alt="" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>Django is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Originally developed by a team of web developers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in 2003 and released publicly in 2005, Django is designed to help developers build web applications quickly, with clean and pragmatic code.

One of Djangoâ€™s key strengths is its "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with many built-in features such as authentication, database management, admin interface, URL routing, and form handling. This reduces the need to rely on external libraries for common tasks, speeding up development time.

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and promotes the reusability of components, scalability, and security. It is widely used for building content management systems, social networks, e-commerce sites, and more. With strong community support and comprehensive documentation, Django is a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers.</p>
