    <p>A framework is a pre-built set of tools, libraries, and best practices that provides a structured foundation for developing software applications. It offers reusable components and a standard way to build and deploy projects, saving developers time and effort. By defining a consistent structure and flow, frameworks help ensure that code is organized, maintainable, and scalable.

Frameworks exist for various programming languages and purposes. For example, in web development, popular frameworks include Django (Python), Spring (Java), and Angular (JavaScript). In machine learning, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch offer powerful tools for model building and training. Each framework typically comes with built-in functionalities, such as database handling, user authentication, and input validation, reducing the need to write code from scratch.

Using a framework enhances productivity, improves code quality, and enforces industry standards. It allows developers to focus more on application logic rather than low-level programming tasks, leading to faster and more reliable software development.</p>
