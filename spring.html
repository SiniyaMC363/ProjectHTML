    <h1>SPRING</h1>
    <img src="./bootsp.png" alt="" height="200px" width="200px">
    <p>Spring is a powerful, lightweight, and open-source framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. Developed by Rod Johnson and released in 2003, Spring simplifies the development process by promoting good design practices such as dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). It provides a comprehensive infrastructure for building scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled applications.

At its core, Spring offers the Spring Container, which manages application components and their lifecycles. Beyond this, it includes a wide range of modules such as Spring MVC for web applications, Spring Boot for rapid development, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Spring Data for database access.

One of Spring’s key advantages is its flexibility—it integrates easily with other frameworks and technologies, making it suitable for microservices, RESTful APIs, and large-scale enterprise systems. Its robust ecosystem, active community, and continuous updates make Spring a preferred choice for modern Java developers.</p>
