Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its clean syntax and English-like commands make it an ideal choice for beginners, while its powerful libraries and frameworks cater to the needs of advanced users and professionals in various domains.

One of Python's greatest strengths lies in its wide range of applications. It is commonly used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), automation, software development, and scientific computing. Libraries such as NumPy and Pandas support data analysis, while TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are popular in AI and ML development. For web development, frameworks like Django and Flask provide robust tools to build secure and scalable web applications.
