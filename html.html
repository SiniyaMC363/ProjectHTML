    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, telling browsers how to display information. HTML uses a system of "elements" or tags that enclose content, defining things like headings, paragraphs, links, and more. It's a foundational technology for the web, working in conjunction with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. 
HTML isn't a programming language; it's a markup language, meaning it uses tags to annotate text and other content. These tags, like p for paragraphs or h1 for headings, instruct the browser on how to render the enclosed information. HTML documents are saved with an .html extension and interpreted by web browsers</p>
